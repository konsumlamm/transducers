# transducers

Transducers in Haskell. Inspired by [this blog post](https://hypirion.com/musings/haskell-transducers).
This package is not on [Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/) and there are currently no plans to change that.
For an alternative, see the [foldl](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/foldl-1.4.6) package.
